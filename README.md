# Voice-Activity-Detection-(VAD)
 

VAD is a technique used to sort Speech and Non-Speech Audio. By implementing this we will receive True(1) or False(0) label with respect to every sample or frame. My some Rough attempts are mentioned in following code. 
While I have noted the sample based VAD might work for similar environment and same speaker but not in general.  That's why energy based (frame) dependent seems more useful. 
If you face any difficulty please drop your query, while I will be structuring the code with time. I'm also planning to explore VAD on other Energy based Features, as till date energy based is the most reliable approach for VAD.  

### Suggestions and Queries are appreciated.
